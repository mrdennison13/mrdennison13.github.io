	  <p>How elastic networks respond to deformation depends
            sensitively on both the properties of the constituent
            filaments and on the network topology. For the former, how
            individual filaments respond to being stretched or
            compressed affects the response at the network level. For
            the latter, important properties include how and where the

	  <p>My research focuses on using computer simulations of

            ways of controlling it, focusing in particular on

          <p class="lead" >Modelling elastics networks</p>
	  
          <p>Perhaps the simplest model elastic networks are
          lattice-based networks of Hookean springs. These are
          constructed by placing network nodes on lattice sites and
          then connecting all nearest neighbours with springs. The
          number of connections at each node is given by the
          connectivity <font color="red">z</font>, and the initial
          value will depend on the lattice used. In 2d, for example,
          beginning from a triangular lattice will
          give <font color="red">z=6</font>, while a square lattice
          has <font color="red">z=4</font>. The network topology can
          then be controlled by randomly diluting the network. That
          is, by randomly removing springs one can control the value
          of <font color="red">z</font>. Since we are using Hookean
          springs, the only response to deformation is when the
          springs are stretched or compressed.</p>
	  
          <p>This lattice based method can also be used in 3d, using,
          for example, simple cubic (<font color="red">z=6</font>) or
          FCC (<font color="red">z=12</font>) based lattices. Other,
          more complex network geometries include Mikado networks,
          where,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikado_(game)" target="_blank">as in
          the game</a>, sticks of equal length are dropped
          randomly. Overlapping sticks are then cross-linked to form a
          network. The key parameter here is the density of sticks,
          which is controlled by randomly removing them. Even more
          removed from lattice based networks are so-called
          random-bond networks, where network nodes are placed
          randomly and randomly chosen pairs are then
          connected.<br><br><br><br> </p>

          <p class="lead" >Thermal fluctuations</p>
	  
          <p>Consider a network of springs at or below the marginal
	    point. It costs no energy to apply a small deformation to
	    such a network. However, by, for example, shearing the
	    network, one reduces the number of states that the network
	    can assume. This results in a decrease in the system
	    entropy and hence an increase in the system
	    free-energy. Therefore, while there is no energy cost
	    associated with (small) network deformations, there is a
	    free energy cost, meaning that the network will begin to
	    resist deformation. Based on the idea
	    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_elasticity" target="_blank">entropic
	    elasticity</a>, when one considers a mechanically floppy
	    network the strength of the response to deformation is
	    expected to scale linearly with the temperature, and to be
	    independent of the mechanical energy of the spring,
	    defined by its spring
	    constant <font color="red">k</font>.</p>
	  
          <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3500.pdf" target="_blank">Using Monte
            Carlo simulations</a>, it is possible to take thermal
            fluctuations into account when modelling elastic
            networks. While it is indeed the case that sub-marginal
            networks exhibit a linear response, that
            is <font color="red">G &prop; T</font>, with no dependence
            on <font color="red">k</font>, marginal networks exhibit a
            response whose dependence on temperature is
            sub-linear. Triangular-lattice based networks diluted to
            the marginal point exhibit a shear modulus that scales
            as <font color="red">G &prop;
            T<sup>1/2</sup>k<sup>1/2</sup></font>. This not only gives
            two control parameters for the network response, namely
            the spring constant and the temperature, but also results
            in a network that has an anomalously high rigidity. That

          <p class="lead">Viscoelastic networks: dynamical behaviour</p>

	  <p>Another interesting aspect of marginal networks is their
	  behaviour in the presence of a solvent. When a dynamical
	  shear (e.g. a shear strain with a fixed amplitude which
	  oscillates with frequency <font color="red">&omega;</font>)
	  is applied to a network in a fluid, a viscous drag will act
	  on it. Furthermore, as the network collide with the fluid
	  particles it generates a hydrodynamic flow field, allowing
	  the network filaments to interact with each other via the
	  fluid. For such a dynamically oscillating system one can
	  measure the dynamical shear
	  modulus <font color="red">G<sup>*</sup> = G<sup>'</sup> +
	  G<sup>''</sup></font>,
	  with <font color="red">G<sup>'</sup></font> the storage
	  modulus (the stored energy, i.e. the elastic part from the
	  springs) and <font color="red">G<sup>''</sup></font> the
	  loss modulus (the energy dissipated as heat, i.e. the
	  viscous part). </p>

	  <p>For networks which are mechanically floppy one would
          expect the modulus to behave as
          a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_material" target="_blank">Maxwell
          fluid</a>, where the storage modulus, for example, scales
          with the shear frequency as <font color="red">G<sup>'</sup>
          &prop;
          &omega;<sup>2</sup></font>. <a href="http://www.itp.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/a3233/upload/AG_Stark/Publikationen_PDF/2016/DennisonStark.pdf" target="_blank">Using
          computer simulations</a> we show that this is indeed the
          case for sub-marginal networks. For marginal networks,
          however, one finds, as for temperature, a sub-linear
          scaling, with <font color="red">G<sup>'</sup> &prop;

          with <font color="red">&alpha;<1</font>, again resulting in
          a network which is anomalously rigid. Interestingly, the
          exponent <font color="red">&alpha;</font> depends on the
          strength of the hydrodynamic interactions between the
          network nodes, and can in fact be controlled by varying
          parameters such as the density of the fluid, giving another
          potential control parameter for the system

          <p class="lead" >And in reality: Detecting marginal networks in experiments</p>
	  
          <p>While marginal networks could potentially be very useful
          materials, experimental evidence for the critical behaviour
          associated with them has thus-far been limited. It is firstly
          very difficult to create a network whose connectivity is at
          or close to the marginal point. Secondly, simulation and
          theoretical evidence indicates that the interesting
          behaviour occurs when the constituent filaments are
          relatively stiff. Synthetic polymer networks tend to allow
          for greater control over the network topology, but they tend
          to be relatively soft. Biopolymers are much stiffer, but one
          has less control over the network
          topology. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4275588/"  target="_blank">Recent
          advances</a> in the production of synthetic polymers have
          produced networks that are of comparable stiffness to
          biopolymer networks, while allowing for control over the
          network topology, potentially paving the way for producing
          marginal networks.</p>
	  
          <p>This still leaves the question of how to detect marginal
          networks. One solution would be to look for signs of
          marginal behaviour in the network's response to
          deformation. Unsurprisingly, it is not really feasible in
          experiments to vary parameters such as the temperature by
          the many orders of magnitude that is possible in computer
          simulations. However, one parameter which can be varied over
          a sufficiently large range is the shear
          stress <font color="red">&sigma;</font>. <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/articlelanding/2016/sm/c6sm01033d/unauth#!divAbstract" target="_blank">Using
          both experimental studies and computer simulations</a> we
          have found that the response of networks of synthetic

          behaviour, scaling as <font color="red">G<sup>'</sup> &prop;
          &sigma;<sup>&alpha;</sup>k<sup>1-&alpha;</sup></font>, even
          in networks well below the marginal point, giving the first
